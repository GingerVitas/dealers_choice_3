                As Act II opened, Countess Almaviva (Bridgette Gan) provided a production highlight with her lamentation over her husband’s infidelity. It was heartfelt and pointed, and labeled Gan as the one to listen to.

                But the real draw is the promising Bridgette Gan as Adina, who made a strong impression in her St. Petersburg Opera debut. From her opening aria, Of the Cruel Isolda, Gan captures the ear and eye with power and precision... It was hard to watch her performance and imagine anyone else playing Adina.
